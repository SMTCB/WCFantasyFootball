## 📋 Current Status Summary

### ✅ Completed
- Squad Screen UX phases 1–3 (mobile tabs, power tools, feature discoverability)
- PowerToolCard component (reusable, active/inactive states)
- E2E test infrastructure synced (82/84 passing)
- Mobile responsive design verified (375px → 1440px)
- App Store / Play Store readiness assessment
- **Draft System — full implementation (S1–S12)**:
  - DB schema: `draft_submissions`, `draft_allocations`, `transfer_windows`, `transfers`, `cup_active_clubs`, `league_config`, `gazette_entries`, `trade_listings`
  - Draft submission screen with ranked list, auto-complete, server-time deadline enforcement, auto-save
  - `run-draft-lottery` Edge Function (random conflict resolution, sequential allocation, gazette report)
  - `run-reverse-standings-draft` Edge Function (worst-rank wins conflicts, cup group → elimination transition)
  - Incomplete squad recovery screen (FCFS, Supabase realtime, optimistic UI)
  - Transfer window enforcement (DB triggers on position caps + window validity)
  - Trade UI extensions (window gating, position pre-check, "list for trade" toggle)
  - Cup pool management (`get_cup_available_players`, `eliminate-cup-club` Edge Function)
  - No-repeat relaxation formula (`calculate_relaxation_state`, `apply_relaxation_state`, `calculate-relaxation` Edge Function)
  - `GazetteDraftReport` component (hybrid headline + bullets + collapsible table)
  - `useTransferWindow` hook + `TransferWindowBanner` component
  - `useRelaxationState` hook
- **#014**: `get_server_time` RPC — migration applied ✅
- **#015**: Draft entry banner in LeagueScreen ✅
- **#006**: Database seeding — 829 EPL players loaded (98 GK / 275 DEF / 379 MID / 97 FWD, 31 clubs) ✅
- **#001**: MarketScreen player loading fixed (isolated fetch, resilient error handling) ✅
- **CI fix**: Replaced `npm ci` → `npm install` in all workflow jobs (lock file sync error resolved) ✅
- **Buy/sell flow redesign** (new — full implementation):
  - `process-transfer` Edge Function: server-side no-repeat check per league, budget credit on sell, position limits, auto-creates squad row on first transfer
  - `useTransfer(leagueId)` hook: `takenMap`, `buy()`, `sell()`, `isTaken()`, `takenBy()`, `isOwnedBy()`
  - `PlayerPickerSheet` component: bottom sheet picker, pre-filtered by position, shows available/taken/over-budget, search
  - SquadScreen: empty slot placeholders per position, tap to open picker sheet, sell now credits budget via Edge Function
  - MarketScreen: league picker (auto-selects if only one), taken-by-manager badge + row dimming, empty slots counter
  - LeagueScreen: "Manage Squad" + "Market" shortcut buttons, both link with `leagueId` context

## 🔴 P0 — Blocking

### #001-E2E: MarketScreen E2E Tests (2 tests still failing)
- **Status**: OPEN (UX bug fixed; E2E environment issue persists)
- **Description**: `MarketScreen › renders player list with names` failing on desktop-chrome + mobile-chrome in E2E. The actual app now loads players correctly. The E2E failure is a Supabase connectivity issue in the test environment.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Mock the Supabase players query in E2E for deterministic results
  2. Or add a `data-testid` fixture bypass in test setup
- **Effort**: 1–2 hours

---

## 🟠 P1 — High

### #016: League Commissioner Panel
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: Several backend capabilities have no admin surface:
  - Open/close transfer windows (insert rows into `transfer_windows`)
  - Advance cup phase (`cup_phase` enum transitions)
  - Eliminate a cup club (calls `eliminate-cup-club` Edge Function)
  - Seed cup clubs when entering cup mode (calls `seed_cup_clubs()`)
  - Set draft deadline on a league
- **Suggested approach**: A commissioner-only tab inside `LeagueScreen` (visible only to `leagues.created_by`).
- **Effort**: 2–3 hours

### #017: Wire Trade Builder to Real Squad Data
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: Trade builder in `LeagueScreen` still uses `MOCK_SQUAD_PLAYERS` (MY PLAYER selector) and `MOCK_PLAYERS_POOL` (THEIR PLAYER selector). Now that `useTransfer` exists and `draft_allocations` is populated, this can be wired to real data. The `TODO` on the position-cap pre-check (`validateAndSendProposal`) also remains open.
- **Fix**: On trade builder open, fetch current manager's allocated players + target manager's allocated players from `draft_allocations` (or `squads` for the current league).
- **Effort**: 1–2 hours

### #018: Configure Supabase Cron Settings
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: Cron migrations (`03_draft_lottery_cron.sql`, `08_reverse_draft_cron.sql`) reference `current_setting('app.supabase_url')` and `current_setting('app.service_role_key')`. These PostgreSQL settings must be configured on the Supabase instance or the cron jobs will fail silently.
- **Fix**: Set via Supabase dashboard → Database → Extensions → pg_cron, or via `ALTER DATABASE ... SET app.supabase_url = '...'`
- **Effort**: 15 minutes (config, not code)

## 🟡 P2 — Medium

### #003: Squad Screen — Desktop Enhancement (Phase 4)
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: Enhance desktop sidebar Chips tab to use `PowerToolCard` components for visual parity with mobile.
- **Location**: `src/screens/SquadScreen.jsx` ~lines 1092–1098
- **Effort**: 45 minutes

### #004: Squad Screen — Onboarding Tour Update (Phase 5)
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: Add tour step for `data-tour="squad-power-tools"` highlighting the 3 power tool cards.
- **Location**: `src/screens/SquadScreen.jsx` ~lines 77–93 (`SQUAD_TOUR_STEPS`)
- **Effort**: 30 minutes

### #019: Pool Pressure Indicator in Draft & Squad Screens
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: `useRelaxationState` hook is built and functional but not surfaced anywhere. Managers in cup leagues have no visibility into the current no-repeat rule status.
- **Fix**: Small banner or badge on `DraftScreen` and `DraftRecoveryScreen`: e.g. "Pool pressure 94% — 1 repeated player allowed per squad."
- **Effort**: 45 minutes

### #020: Draft Deadline Notifications
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: No push notification or email when a draft deadline is approaching or when lottery results are published. Managers may miss the draft entirely.
- **Suggested**: Push notification 48h before deadline + gazette entry on lottery completion (already written by Edge Function — notification layer missing).
- **Effort**: 2 hours (depends on push notification infrastructure)

### #021: Transfer Window Auto-Scheduler
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Description**: `transfer_windows` table exists and enforcement is wired, but rows must currently be created manually by the commissioner (#016). For league format, windows should open/close automatically based on fixture schedule.
- **Logic**: After each matchday's last fixture ends, open a standard window for 48h with `transfers_remaining = 5` (or null for unlimited windows).
- **Effort**: 2 hours (Edge Function + cron)

### #022: Squad Screen — Player Click Bottom Sheet (Mobile)
- **Status**: NOT VERIFIED
- **Description**: Tapping a player on mobile Squad screen should open the action bottom sheet (Set Captain, Sub, Sell). Reported as not working. May be a z-index or event propagation issue introduced by the empty slot placeholders.
- **Effort**: 30 minutes investigation

## 🔵 Roadmap — Future Features

### #012: Gazette — Extended Dynamic Content
- **Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: `GazetteDraftReport` component built and wired. Gazette now shows draft reports with headline + bullets + collapsible table. Remaining: design treatment for `breaking_news` entries (club eliminations, rule changes) and `auction_result` type once #013 is built.
- **Dependency**: #013 for auction entries
- **Effort**: Medium

### #013: In-League Player Auction System
- **Status**: OPEN — high-level spec in `DRAFT_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
- **Description**: Manager lists a player for auction within their league. Others bid using budget and/or points. Time-boxed, only during transfer windows. Seller must acquire a replacement for the vacated position before auction closes.
- **Dependency**: #016 (transfer window infrastructure must be live)
- **Effort**: Medium-large — new UI flow + bidding state machine + resolution logic

## 🟢 P3 — Polish

### #005: Verify Mobile PowerToolCard Rendering
- **Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION
- **Steps**: `/squad` on 375px → Tools tab → confirm 3 cards render, interactions work, confirm modals appear
- **Effort**: 20 minutes

### #007: Mobile Tab Icon Refinement
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Description**: Current: ⚽ Pitch, 📋 Squad, ⚙️ Tools. Consider: ⚽ Pitch, 👥 Squad, ⚡ Tools
- **Effort**: 15 minutes

### #008: Onboarding Tour — Hardcoded Delays
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Location**: `src/components/OnboardingTour.jsx` line ~56
- **Fix**: Replace `setTimeout` with `waitFor()`
- **Effort**: 20 minutes

### #009: PowerToolCard — Description Prop
- **Status**: NOT USED
- **Description**: Component supports `description` prop — add: Wildcard "Unlimited free transfers", Triple Captain "3× captain points", Roulette "Random captain picker"
- **Effort**: 15 minutes

### #010: CSS Animation Performance
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Description**: PowerToolCard pulse animation defined inline. Move to global CSS, add `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- **Effort**: 30 minutes
