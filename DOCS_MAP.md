## Maintenance Notes

- **Update Frequency**: 
  - Root-level docs (BACKLOG.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md): After each session
  - Architecture docs: When features ship or systems change
  - Testing/product docs: When roadmap or strategy changes
  - Reference docs: When conventions or setup changes
  
- **Review Process**: Before any major release, verify:
  - All architecture docs match current code
  - Testing strategy reflects actual test coverage
  - PIPELINE.md aligns with current roadmap
  
- **Consolidation**: Intermediate work (audits, session notes) goes directly to `docs/archive/`; never leave temp files in root or docs/

- **Link Validation**: All links in this map should resolve correctly — if broken, update this file immediately

- **Single Source of Truth**: 
  - [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) — all open issues and completed work
  - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — authoritative project instructions
  - [docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) — test framework details
  - [docs/product/PIPELINE.md](docs/product/PIPELINE.md) — delivery timeline
  - [docs/reference/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/reference/CONVENTIONS.md) — code style rules

## Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date**: 2026-05-28  
**Scope**: Complete reorganization of 30+ documentation files across root and docs/ folder  
**Actions Taken**:
1. Created 4 new top-level doc folders (testing, product, reference + archive reorganization)
2. Moved 9 core files to appropriate categories (PIPELINE, APP_DYNAMICS, E2E_TEST_PLAYBOOK, etc)
3. Removed 3 duplicate files (APP_STORE_ASSESSMENT, MOBILE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE from docs/)
4. Created 6 new documentation files (README/index files for each category + FORMATION_RULES, LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT, CONVENTIONS, TESTING_STRATEGY)
5. Archived 13 intermediate/stale files (audits, strategic docs, working notes) to docs/archive/
6. Updated DOCS_MAP.md as master index of all documentation

**Result**: 
- Root folder reduced from 18 to 8 essential files
- Documentation organized by topic (architecture, api, brand, deployment, testing, product, reference)
- Clear ownership and maintenance path for each document category
- BACKLOG.md established as single source of truth for task management
- All documentation now discoverable from DOCS_MAP.md

Last Updated: **2026-06-08** (POOL_RELAXATION_SYSTEM.md added — player-repeat + club-cap formulas, full implementation map; DRAFT_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md updated — draft_list_size default 45)
